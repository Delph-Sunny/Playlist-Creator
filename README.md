# MY COOL PLAYLIST

## Description 


```
USER STORY
```
As a fan of music, I would have a music app so I can have playlists with my favorite songs and lyrics.  
The criteria for this app are:   
 - A splash screen appears only the first time the app is launched during a session.  
 - The home page should have all previously created playlists, which could be removed individually or all at once. It also has a link to create a new playlist.  
 - The new playlist contains a name, a description and an avatar.  
 - The search page returns the results of 2 APIS with the songs information and youtube link.  
 - The song can be added to the active playlist and store.   
 - The list of songs of a playlist can be edited by removing individually each song.  
 - The app should be responsive.
